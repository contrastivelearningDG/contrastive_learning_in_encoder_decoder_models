# Contrastive_Learning_in_Encoder_Decoder_Models
This is the code implementation for the paper:
**Enhancing Objective Query Distractor Generation in Pre-trained Encoder-Decoder Models via Contrastive Learning**
The paper is still under review in ACL 2025 submission.

We currently provide part of the code and the output results, and we will provide the full code implementation upon reviewing decision.

# Datasets
The selected datasets are [MCQ](https://github.com/DRSY/DGen) dataset and [SciQ](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/sciq) dataset
